# ATMS 523 Module 3: Climate Analysis of Shreveport, LA

This repository contains code and notebooks for completing Module 3 of ATMS 523, focused on analyzing historical climate data using the NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCN-D) dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Download and process daily temperature data for a selected GHCN station (Shreveport, LA).
- Calculate climatological statistics for each calendar day from 1991–2020:
  - Record high and low temperatures
  - Average high and low temperatures
- Visualize these statistics alongside actual daily temperatures from a chosen year (2020).

## Visualization

The final output is a line plot showing:
- Record and average high/low temperatures (1991–2020)
- Actual high/low temperatures for Shreveport in 2020
