# ATMS 523 Module-3 Project

This repository contains my project for module 3. The notebook contains code that takes in data from the Purdue station and calculates temperature statistics in the 1991-2020 period including: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average maximum temperature, and average minimum temperature. This is done for each calendar day and culminates with a seasonality plot to illustrate the results.
