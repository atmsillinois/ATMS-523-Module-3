# ATMS-523-Module-3  Alexa Taylor

Module Homework #3 for ATMS 523. In this homwork I read in the GHCN data for Rangeley, Maine. I then created a function that calculated the all time record high and low along with the average high and low for each day. I then took the data just from 1996 and plotted this using the Bokher example.
